# SWIMCurser - Scroll Without Moving Cursor

Lets you scroll up and down using your keyboard without moving the cursor.
Supports both per line scrolling and page up/down, as well as configuration
to adjust the scroll speed.

Special thanks to abe33 for publishing [the following code](https://gist.github.com/abe33/6685d1581d73fd46fe4e)
which allowed me to quick-start developing in coffeescript and atom.
This is my first project in coffeescript, so it was very helpful.
